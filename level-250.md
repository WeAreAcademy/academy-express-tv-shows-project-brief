# Level 250 - Add Favourite episodes

1. Complete all requirements from Level 200
1. Add a "Mark as Favourite" button on each episode
    1. A user should be able to click on "Mark as Favourite" (or appropriate icon (e.g. an unlit star)) on any episode to mark it as a favourite.
    1. Episodes which are already a favourite should indicate that (e.g. with a lit star icon)
    1. The button should be implemented as a form which uses POST method
    1. The id of the favourite should be stored in an appropriate database table
1. Add a "favourite episodes" view:
    1. This should be a distinct URL which, when visited, shows a list of the favourite episodes.

Don't worry about multi-user capabilities at this point. If _anyone_ favourites an episode, it will be marked favourite for _all_ users. Consider the app a tool for a single user or team. User login is a little out of scope for this project.
