# Level 200 - Add Search

1. Complete all requirements from Level 100
1. Add a "live" search input:
    1. Only episodes whose `summary` **OR** `name` contains the search term should be displayed
    1. The search should be case-**in**sensitive
    1. Display how many episodes match the current search
    1. If the search box is cleared and submitted, **all** episodes should be shown.
    1. Extract this episode-matching functionality into a pure function and create unit tests for it with jest.

## Example screenshot of search

Note: Provided your project meets the above requirements, it can **look** however you want.

Here is one example layout.
