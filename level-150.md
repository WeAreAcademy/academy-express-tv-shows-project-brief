# Level 150 - Click to get details of one episode

1. Complete all minimal requirements from previous levels
1. Clicking on an episode title should display a new page with details of that episode. On that page:
    1. More of the episode properties should be visible, specifically at least: runtime, airdate, and the average rating
    1. The "original" size episode image should be used instead of the thumbnail
1. Add a nav bar header with at least a link to the full episode link, to allow the user to return easily from the single-episode view.

Note: Provided your project meets the above requirements, it can **look** however you want.
